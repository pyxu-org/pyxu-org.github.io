    "to computer vision. They strive to improve degraded or partially captured raw images, transforming them into\n",
    "superior-quality versions better aligned for visualization or image analysis. The resultant images often boast enhanced\n",

    "\n",
    "At the core of many image reconstruction techniques lies the challenge of solving a mathematical inverse problem. Here's\n",
    "how it works: an object of interest — be it a cell, a scene, or something else — is observed through an acquisition\n",
    "system, such as a microscope or camera. This system collects data that is both noisy and blurred. The ultimate objective\n",
    "is to reconstruct the original object from these imperfect measurements, effectively \"inverting\" the acquisition process\n",
    "to obtain a clearer image or representation. The diagram below succinctly illustrates an inverse problem setting:"
