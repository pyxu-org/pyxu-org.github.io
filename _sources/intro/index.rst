Why is Pyxu Necessary?
----------------------

In the realm of computer vision 📷, digital image restoration and enhancement techniques have established themselves as indispensable pillars. 
These techniques, aiming to restore and elevate the quality of degraded or partially observed images, have witnessed unprecedented progress 📈 in recent times. 
Thanks to potent image priors, we've now reached an era where image restoration and enhancement methods are incredibly advanced ✨ —so much so that we might be approaching a pinnacle in terms of performance and accuracy.

However, it's not all roses 🌹.

Despite their leaps in progress, advanced image reconstruction methods often find themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of limited adaptability, usability, and reproducibility. 
Many advanced computational imaging solutions, while effective, are tailored for specific use-cases and seldom venture beyond the confines of a proof-of-concept 🚧. 
These niche solutions demand deep expertise to customize and deploy, making their adoption in production pipelines challenging.

In essence, the imaging domain is desperately seeking what the deep learning community found in frameworks like `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_, or `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ —a flexible, modular, and powerful environment that accelerates the adoption of cutting-edge methods in real-world settings.
Pyxu stands as an answer to this call: a groundbreaking, open-source computational imaging software framework tailored for Python enthusiasts 🐍.
