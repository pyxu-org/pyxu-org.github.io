.. note:: 

   This comparison excludes traditional medical imaging frameworks like `TomoPy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `ASTRA <https://www.astra-toolbox.com/>`_, 
   as well as general-purpose optimization frameworks (e.g., `scipy.optimize <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`_, 
   `MATLAB's Optimization <https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/optimization-toolbox.html>`_ or `CVX toolboxes <http://cvxr.com/cvx/>`_) and 
   deep learning frameworks (e.g., `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, 
   `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_, `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_). 
   These exclusions are due to their architectural limitations or the narrow focus of their optimization methods, 
   which are unsuitable for the diverse requirements of modern computational imaging.

SCICO: A Closer Look
--------------------

Although SCICO is almost feature-complete, it relies on `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, which has some drawbacks:

1. **Experimental Framework**: JAX is relatively young and is still officially considered experimental. If you're looking for a stable, long-term solution, this could be a concern.

2. **Expertise Required**: Working with JAX requires a deep understanding of functional programming to avoid pitfalls and debugging headaches.

3. **CPU Optimization**: JAX is not optimized for CPU computing, making it less versatile than NumPy in some scenarios.

4. **Platform Support**: JAX doesn't support Windows, limiting its adoption among those who use Windows-based systems.

DeepInv: A Note on Usability
----------------------------

DeepInv is based on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, making it less portable due to its numerous dependencies. 
Moreover, it's primarily designed for deep learning users, making it less accessible for imaging scientists who may not be as well-versed in deep learning paradigms.

Conclusion
----------

While all the frameworks discussed here have their merits, Pyxu appears to offer the most well-rounded set of features, robustness, and ease-of-use. 
Its support for distributed and GPU computing adds to its advantages, making it a leading choice for computational imaging applications.
