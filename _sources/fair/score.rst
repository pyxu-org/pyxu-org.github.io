Pyxu Score Explained
====================

The **Pyxu Score** is a quantitative measure we use to rank and evaluate Pyxu plugins. The score takes into account multiple criteria, ensuring you get a holistic understanding of a plugin's standing. Here's a breakdown:

The Pyxu Score is calculated using the following criteria:

1. **Version Matching**: If a plugin's version matches the latest Pyxu version, it gets a point.
2. **Pyxu Principles Adherence**: Plugins abiding by key Pyxu principles – namely:
    * Input shape agnosticity (i.e., support for NDArrays),
    * Complete backend-agnosticity (i.e., support for Numpy, Cupy and Dask arrays),
    * Precision management (i.e., allow selection between computation at both single and double precision)

   *(each earn an additional point)*

3. **Development Stage Weight**:
    * **Early stages** (Planning 📑, Pre-Alpha 🌒, Alpha 🌓) contribute 0.5 points.
    * **Advanced stages** (Beta 🌔, Production/Stable ✔️, Mature 🌟) contribute 1 point.
    * **Inactive 🚫** plugins, however, aren't factored into the final score.

4. **Downloads ⬇️**: Plugins get points based on the number of downloads in the last month, up to a maximum of 1 point for 1000 downloads.

The final score is then normalized by the number of criteria used (6 in this case) and presented as a percentage.

**Note**: While the Pyxu Score offers insights into a plugin's quality and popularity, it's just one of many metrics. Users are encouraged to explore plugins individually and consider other factors before making a decision.

Your insights matter! If you're a developer with ideas on how we can further refine the Pyxu Score, we'd love to hear from you. 💡

We invite you to **open an issue** suggesting novel metrics or criteria that, in your opinion, would better represent the value and quality of Pyxu plugins. By contributing your thoughts, you play an integral role in refining and shaping the Pyxu community's standards.

Together, let's make the Pyxu Score the best reflection of plugin excellence! 🌟
